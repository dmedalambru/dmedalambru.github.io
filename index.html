  <p> I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Philosophy and has earned graduate certificates in Latino/a Mexican-American Studies and Women’s and Gender Studies. Her primary areas of study are in Latin American philosophy and Latinx philosophy. Denise’s dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to theorize communal interpretations of death. In particular, she analyzes how Días de los Muertos (Days of the Dead) commemorations and altar-making practices support community practices of resistance to legacies of colonialism.
  <br>
  <p> In addition to her scholarship, Denise is a research assistant to Dr. Sonia Hernandez and Dr. Nancy Plankey-Videla for The Mexican Re-Integration Project, which examines examine the diverse experiences of deportees and returnees to Mexico from the United States in collaboration with the Texas A&M University School of Law.</br> </p>
